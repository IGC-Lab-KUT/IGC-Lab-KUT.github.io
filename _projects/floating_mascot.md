## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raselmandol/floating_mascot.git
cd floating_mascot
```

## Virtual Environment Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment called `mascot`:

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv mascot
mascot\Scripts\activate
```

---

##  Install Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
## Usage

Make sure you're in the project folder, then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

---


##  Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PyQt6
- PyOpenGL
- Pillow (for GIF/image handling)

---

##  Build Executable (Windows)

if you want to create an `.exe`:

### Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

> **Note:** Already added in `requirements.txt`. (If you want to ignore it, make sure to remove it from `requirements.txt`.)


Convert your PNG icon to ICO.

### Run:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico main.py
   ```

---

## Keyboard Shortcut

You can **toggle the floating mascot** (hide/show), and **toggle background music** (pause/unpause) using the keyboard shortcut:

Floating mascot:
```
Ctrl + Alt + M
```
Background music:
```
Ctrl + Alt + S
```


This makes it easy to hide the window when you're working, bring it back anytime, and pause/unpause the audio anytime.

### Requirements

Make sure you have the `keyboard` module installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(already added -> requirements.txt)

> Note: The `keyboard` module may require administrator/root permissions on some systems.

### Change the Shortcut

To use a different shortcut, open `floating_window.py` and find this line:

```python
keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+alt+m', self.toggle_visibility)
```
Change `'ctrl+alt+m'` to any other key combination, like `'ctrl+shift+z'` or `'f12'`.

To use a different shortcut (music), open `settings_window.py` and find this line:

```python
keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+alt+s', self._toggle_music)
```

Change `'ctrl+alt+s'` to any other key combination, like `'ctrl+shift+z'` or `'f12'`.
